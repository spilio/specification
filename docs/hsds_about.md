About the Human Services Data Spec
=====

The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS; aka, the Open Referral format) is an exchange format for publishing machine readable data about health, human, and social services, their locations, and the organizations that provide them. We define "human services" broadly, to include any organizational resource that is made available for a person in need – such as food assistance, job training, child care, etc. 

**The primary use case served by HSDS is the provision of human service directory information as "open data," to be consumed by any third-party information system.**

Government entities, community organizations, and people often face difficulty obtaining timely and correct data about human services. The Human Services Data Specification facilitates the open exchange and use of human service data (often known as "community resource data") among these stakeholders. To that end, this is an interchange format designed to complement – _not replace_ – existing storage formats currently in use.

All organizations that provide services or referrals to services, as well as entities that distribute digital human service directory information, are invited to publish their data in this format, whether they be governments at the local, state, or federal level; civic organizations; software developers; etc.
